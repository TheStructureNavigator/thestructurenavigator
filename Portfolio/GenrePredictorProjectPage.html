								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									The project aims to develop a genre prediction system utilizing 
									machine learning (ML) algorithms and neural network models. 
									The goal is to accurately classify music into different genres 
									based on their audio features. The ability to automatically predict 
									genres has significant implications for various applications, 
									including music recommendation systems, playlist generation, 
									and music streaming platforms. Traditionally, genre classification 
									has been a subjective and manual process, relying on human judgment 
									and expertise. However, with the advancements in ML and deep learning 
									techniques, it has become possible to build automated models that can 
									learn and recognize patterns within music data to predict genres 
									accurately.
								</p>
								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>
									The project consists of three main modules that collectively aim 
									to predict music genres using machine learning algorithms and 
									neural network models. Each module serves a specific purpose in 
									the genre prediction pipeline, enabling data extraction and 
									preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and neural 
									network-based predictions.
								</p>
								<h4>Module I: Genres Dataset Generator</h4>
								<p>
									This module focuses on extracting audio features from songs 
									available on Spotify and modifying the extracted dataframes 
									using the pandas library. The audio features, such as tempo, 
									energy and danceability, are crucial inputs for genre prediction 
									models. The module ensures the extracted dataframes are 
									appropriately prepared to serve as inputs for both ML models 
									and neural network models.
								</p>
								<h4>Module II: ML Algorithms Predictors</h4>
								<p>
									In this module, selected ML algorithms are employed for genre 
									prediction tasks. The module facilitates the training, 
									evaluation, and prediction processes using these ML algorithms. 
									Various algorithms, such as decision trees, random forests, or SGD
									can be utilized to build genre prediction models. 
									The module enables the selection and fine-tuning of these 
									algorithms to achieve optimal genre classification performance.
								</p>
								<h4>Module III: Neural Network Predictor</h4>
								<p>
									This module allows data preparation, preprocessing, exploratory 
									data analysis (EDA), creating sequential neural network models, 
									hyperparameter tuning, generating predictions, and visualizations. 
									It handles the transformation of data into suitable formats for 
									neural networks, conducts EDA to gain insights, builds sequential 
									models, optimizes hyperparameters, trains and evaluates models, 
									generates genre predictions, and creates visualizations. 
								</p>
								<h2>Analysis and research results</h2>
								<h4>I: Training Data</h4>
								<p>
									In order to conduct the analysis, data was collected regarding the 
									audio features of 6,000 songs. This data was obtained from featured 
									playlists on Spotify for specific music genres. The collected data 
									was divided into 6 groups, each containing approximately 1,000 records, 
									and the corresponding genre was assigned to each subset. Six general 
									genres were selected for the analysis: Classical, Alternative, Electronic, 
									HipHop, Pop, and Rock. 

									Module 1 facilitated the export of data into Pandas dataframes and the 
									creation of multiple datasets with variations based on the selected modifications. 
									The available modifications were as follows:
									<br />
									<br />
									<b>Populating Median Neighbourhood (PMN):</b> This modification allowed for the 
									generation of additional random samples within the range where the sample 
									density was highest.
									<br />
									<b>Calculated Features (CF):</b> This modification enabled the derivation of 
									additional information to extract additional relationships between 
									individual samples.
									<br />
									<b>Trimming (Trim):</b> This modification allowed for the removal of outliers 
									for selected features.
									<br />
									These modifications provided flexibility in analyzing the data and 
									exploring different aspects of the relationship between audio features 
									and genres.
								</p>
								<h4>II: ML Algorithms</h4>
								<p>
									The generated datasets were used as training sets for ML algorithms. 
									Four algorithms were utilized during the analysis:
									<br />
									1. Decision Trees
									<br />
									2. Random Forests
									<br /> 
									3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
									<br />
									4. k-Nearest Neighbors
									<br />
									Depending on the selected dataset, the parameters for each algorithm were 
									tuned using the GridSearchCV method from the sklearn library. Evaluation 
									on the test set revealed that the above algorithms achieved varying 
									percentages of accurate predictions for different modifications.
									<br />
									<br />
									Among the algorithms used, the Random Forest algorithm achieved the 
									best result for the populated data. Below are the prediction [%] results 
									and an example confusion matrix for the best-performing algorithm

										{'alternative': 0,
										'classical': 1,
										'electronic': 2,
										'hiphop': 3,
										'pop': 4,
										'rock': 5}</p>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images/mlaconfmatrix.png" alt="" /></div>
									The Module II, available on GitHub, provides numerous possibilities for 
									additional modifications and methods for selecting individual songs and 
									assigning them appropriate genres to effectively train the algorithms. 
									This module offers flexibility and options to further enhance the training 
									process and improve the accuracy of genre prediction.

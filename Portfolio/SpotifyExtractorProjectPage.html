								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									The Spotify Extractor (SE) is a tool designed for various 
									purposes, including extracting comprehensive information and data 
									about song features directly from the Spotify database. 
									With this tool, you can effortlessly gather details about songs, 
									such as their characteristics and attributes. Moreover, it 
									provides the ability to edit the collected information for 
									specific tracks, allowing for customization and refinement. 
									Additionally, the SE tool empowers users to perform preliminary 
									data analysis and visualize the distinctive features of songs, 
									enabling a deeper understanding and exploration of the music 
									collection.
								</p>
								<h2>Project Overview</h2>
								<p>
									The Spotify Extractor was written in Python, utilizing the 
									Streamlit library, which allowed for the creation of an intuitive 
									API. SE is comprised of specialized modules that facilitate 
									specific functionalities and actions.
								</p>
								<h4>Module I: Data Extractor</h4>
								<p>
									The Data Extractor enables the extraction of data pertaining 
									to selected songs and presents it in a tabular format using 
									the pandas library. To obtain the desired information, users 
									can manually input or import a file containing a list of URLs 
									for individual songs, playlists, albums, or artists. 
									The extracted data encompasses various details about each track, 
									including its distinctive features. Once the tracklist is extracted, 
									users can conveniently display the generated table and save it to a 
									file for further use.
								</p>
								<h4>Module II: Data Loader</h4>
								<p>
									The Data Loader module provides users with the capability to load 
									pre-extracted or prepared dataframes. These loaded dataframes can 
									be modified and saved to a new file for subsequent processing or 
									analysis. Moreover, the module offers supplementary information 
									about the loaded data, aiding users in their analytical tasks. 
									An information scheme is constructed specifically for the data 
									extracted by the extractor module
								</p>
								<h4>Module III: Data Updater</h4>
								<p>
									The Data Updater feature enables users to update existing 
									tracklists by adding additional tracks to them. The updater 
									specifically extracts information only for tracks that are 
									not already included in the updated tracklist. This ensures 
									that only new track information is extracted and added, 
									minimizing redundancy and optimizing the updating process.
								</p>
								<h4>Module IV: Recommender</h4>
								<p>
									The Recommender module empowers users to generate a curated 
									list of recommendations based on a given set of tracks. 
									By uploading another tracklist provided by the user, the 
									module selects recommendations from that specific tracklist. 
									This functionality allows users to discover new and similar 
									tracks based on their preferences and the uploaded tracklist.
								</p>
								<h4>Module V: Data Analysis</h4>
								<p>
									The Data Analysis module offers users the ability to conduct 
									preliminary analysis on generated tracklists and visualize 
									key elements such as correlation matrices, count plots, 
									bar plots, and scatter plots. Additionally, a radar plot 
									is generated to showcase the distinctive features of the 
									loaded tracklist for analysis. This module provides valuable 
									insights into the data, enabling users to explore relationships 
									and patterns within the tracklist and gain a deeper understanding 
									of its characteristics.
